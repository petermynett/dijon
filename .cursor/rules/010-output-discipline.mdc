# Output Discipline

This rule governs **how results are communicated**.
It exists to keep work auditable, fast to review, and easy to reproduce.

## Before Making Changes

If the task is non-trivial:

- Briefly state what you intend to do (1–3 bullets)
- Do not summarize or restate the request
- Do not preemptively read or quote large docs unless required by Rule 000

## While Working

- Avoid narrating internal reasoning or step-by-step thought
- Avoid broad context dumps or speculative explanations
- Make only the smallest change necessary to satisfy the request

## Reporting Changes

When changes are made, explicitly state:

- What files were changed
- What was added, removed, or modified (briefly)
- Any assumptions made

Do not say “updated as requested” without specifics.

## Commands & Reproducibility

If commands are relevant (tests, installs, CLI usage):

- Show the **exact command(s)** to run
- Do not paraphrase commands
- Do not assume tools or environments beyond what is documented

## Tests

Follow Rule 700 for when/how to run tests.

At the end of the task, clearly state test status using one of:

- `Tests: PASSED`
- `Tests: FAILED`
- `Tests: NOT RUN`

Include exact command(s) where applicable.

## End-of-Task Summary

Omit the end-of-task summary unless explicitly requested by the user. Focus on delivering recommendations and results only.
