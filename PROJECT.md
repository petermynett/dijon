This project explores how musical form, melody, and harmony can be analyzed across multiple performances of the same tune using techniques from music information retrieval. It combines a small, manually annotated corpus with larger-scale automated analysis to surface patterns, variation, and ambiguity in repertoires like jazz and bluegrass that lack fixed scores. Rather than privileging transcription accuracy, the focus is on comparative, musicological insight supported by reproducible pipelines and exploratory visualizations. The system treats multiple interpretations as first-class outcomes, using computation to support analysis rather than to enforce a single “correct” reading.
